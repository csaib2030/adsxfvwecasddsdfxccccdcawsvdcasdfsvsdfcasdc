            The first Banglore trip we had was very memorable for me (i'm sure it was for you also). I remember the tinch of nervousness I had when I was waiting at your house for you while you were coming back from your office. But all of it faded away as soon as you came. I had never felt so comfortable so quick with someone. Like we started talking 2 months ago and we are sleeping together today? Uh - wtf? asfdafawefwefefasfsdxf. I kept thinking throughout, what is it that is so different? how am I so comfirtable with you? and I had an answer at the end of the trip. It was you. Ik very cheesy but let me be today. It was your warm and caring nature. The way you just love doing things be it going on giant wheels (which make me puke) or reading books or having sex or just talking for hours and hours or just having boring dhosas. I am genuinely amazed at the amount of fun you have while doing these small routine things. It is something I admire about you alot. It is so cool to be excited about your everyday life and and seeing you excited about your life fullfuils me to the core. Everyday, I can't wait to hear how you had so much fun while sleeping in a sleeping pod at your office. It's a collection of all of these tiny cute and warm things that you do and the person who you are that makes me so comfortable with you. I have never in my life been closer to a human being, never felt so at home you know. And thank you so much for that, my life quite literally started turning around after you came into it.
