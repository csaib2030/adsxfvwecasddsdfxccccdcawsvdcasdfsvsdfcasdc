            This has to be my favourite mirror for taking photos and for sticking a finger in your mouth also (hehe im sorry I lou you). This was one of the last days of our banglore trip and I was at so much peace. I was going to propose you tomorrow. And for a change I wasn't nervous this time, I was comfortable I was.. happy? I was at peace. At peace with you in it. And ever since I have had that feeling, all of my goals in my life have changed. Before that trip I was the kinda guy who would walk over and out of every relationship if it helped my chase my hustle and was in a complete grind mindset. But after that trip, after that feeling, after you I changed my mind and myself so much. I wanted to have a good relationship that gives me peace and love. This is one of the biggest changes I have had in my life after I have had you in it and I am so grateful for it. The amount of fulfillment and satisfaction I get by being withh you is out of this world. I hope I am able to give you the same amount of peace and love back.
