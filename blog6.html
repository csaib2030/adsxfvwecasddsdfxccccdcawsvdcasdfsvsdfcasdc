            Being with you in campus was so much better than I expected. Every day made me feel we should've met earlier so we could spend more time in college. In the very little time we had I am so glad we did everythin we could ibaco, cuppers, seimens, tv tower and biotech also ;) The amount of love people gave us was also so crazy no. I wish I could have explored the campus more with you and we had more time but I am glad we did whatever we could.. And I am so grateful for that, that was the only little college romance I had ever experienced and I loved it so much. I wish we could spend more time at the atm :)
