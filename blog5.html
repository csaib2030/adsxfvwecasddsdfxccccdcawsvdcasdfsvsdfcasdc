            I have added this photo for two reasons. One this was the first time anyone of us was drunk infront of the other. You look like the cutest kid in the world when you are drunk. And I love you despite you puking on my dick or puke kissing me (that is hot tbvh). Second I miss kissing you so so much, like so so much. AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA. I had to add a horny episode in so much cheese to make it sound like me. I love you and I miss kissing you so much.
