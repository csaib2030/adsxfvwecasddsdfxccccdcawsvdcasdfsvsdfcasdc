            Happy Anniversary Kyasaram. I Lou you so so so so so much. Never did I imagine how crazy of a story one T.V tower trip would give me. I still remember my awkward nervous ass getting ready for our dates. I didn't wash my hair for the past 4 days so that they could look nice and I could impress this cute little south indian. Before leaving my room I remember panicing ki fuck my hair still look terrible, but little did I know my nose was all that was required. And I am so glad my nose was able to pull a hot cute pookie mature caring hot beautiful rich amazing sexy and louly south indian like you. Ever since you have been in my life it has been nothin but amazing. I don't think there is any way in this world that I can thank you for that but here is a smmol annivarsary gift for you. This is a our website and I will keep uppdating this over the time so this can be our cute little archive. Now go back and click all of the pictures on the site, they all have smol messages for you. I Love You &lt;3
