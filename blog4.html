            This is one of the ghibli pitches I made during the ghibli trend. I made many more but this is my absolute favourite. It shows exactly how I want us to be. I look kinda nervous? I wasn't smiling as the ghibli art shows. I was grinning because I was so happy tobe with you, I was happy to the point of being nervous. And you on my right were peacfully, comfortabley smiling. And you being at peace with me and because of me gives me literal goosebumps and that is all I want for the rest of my life. Even right now with all the revoke bs I love those small moments we speak on call and you are a happy peaceful kid. It jainwinly makes my entire day. This photo is how I want us to be througout are life, I want nothing more.
