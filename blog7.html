            We have come to the last photo as of now and it had to be the last photo we had together. I miss you so so much Kyasaram. Thank you so much for everything, I know I have said this over and over in the last photos but I can't help it because it is the absolute truth. Thank you so much for pouring life in me for making my life so so much better, for keeping me sane on my worst days and being in my life. I love listening to you speak in your cute voice, watching your poop photos, watching your pookie face in a helmet which makes you look so cute, making you laugh and more than anything, I absolutely love talking to you. I can do that all day every day for my entire life and that is what I want to do. I really really love you, I'm sorry the situation is a problem right now and I am so thankful that you are being so supportive and mature about it, I genuinely don't know what I would do with you. Having said that do not hold back from calling me, I am in a tough situation but the only thing that can make me feel worse is nt being able to help my own girlfriend, listening to you rant and freak out and be there for you is something that completes me and is very important for the people pleaser in me. Everytime you think you shouldn't rant in front of me just remember it is important for me as well that you are ranting to me, okay? Please don't ever not tell me shit that you are going through I want to be there for you and I am here for you all fucking ways. I am so glad I am with an incredible woman like you. But things will get better for us and I know for a fact if anyone is worth going so much ldr pain for, it is you (I stole this dailogue from you hehe). You are the one. I love you so so much. I don't pray but I thank the world everyday that I have you in my life. Please stay the way you are and always be with me, we'll come out glorious out of this ldr bs; I promise. One last thing before I end, go to the menu on the main page from the two lines on the top right, i have a last cute thing for you. I Love You Kyasaram. Happy Anniversary. You are the best person alive.
